Marquee Text

Overlay for Playclaw 5 Plus.

This overlay simply displays text from a file, all on a single line, and if the text is too long to fit in the overlay's boundaries, the text will slowly scroll. If the file changes the text will be reloaded and the new text will replace the original.

It is primarily meant for use with other programs which save your currently playing music track to a text file, such as Snip ( https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip/releases/latest ), but feel free to use it for anything you wish.
